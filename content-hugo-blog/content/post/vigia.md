A permanent comforting lullaby  
that takes me through the day. 

A perfume  
of salt and algae  
creeps around me and everywhere,  
an ubiquitous presence  
a dominion of sorts  
suggesting an incomprehensible temporality.

The cold wind  
carrying a salty mist  
caresses me  
with revitalizing tenderness.  

And the sun  
With soothing warmth  
brings me an earthy feeling of  
certainty.

Precious moments,  
awareness of insignificance.

The morning sky  
Blends with the sea.  
In a battle for independence,  
For identity  
The sun brings them apart  
And exalts their unique wonders.

The sound of rocks retreating with the surf,  
The sound of the surf breaking on the rocks,  
The sound of bubbling air escaping through the sand,  
The symphony of seagulls and pelicans, sea lions and ducks.

Ephemeral and yet  
persistent tracks,  
new and the same,  
washed out once and again.

The blue sky  
So blue it is an ocean on its own  
navigating magnificent vessels  
carrying the whitest cotton  
or the darkest oil  
Sometimes racing so fast  
Leaving only their tracks.

But is when the pelicans set off to fly  
In perfect formation  
so close to the sea  
daring not to touch  
searching  
patiently  
for the school.

It is then  
when the sun burns  
and the sky gives in  
to a colorful pallet  
And the sea burns with the sun,

It is then,  
It is time  
The school has been found  
And the Pelicans fly up  
So high  
Floating for a second   
Folding  
And racing down  
In a synchronized dive.
