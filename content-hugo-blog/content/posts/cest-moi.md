A physicist that once fell to the stars of Astrophysics.

However, being experimentalist and theoretician at heart,  
her love eventually fell for molecular Biophysics,  
researching the cooperative but elusive behavior of lipids  
designed nanoliposomes for targeted drug delivery.

Her first close encounter with a computer  
was a PRIME 750, exclusively used  
to scare mother, who run batch jobs  
filling her terminal screen  
with infinite error messages and warnings.

As a good physicist,  
only UNIX style computing was acceptable.  
Unfortunately learned some Windows  
well into the new millennium  
which then regretted quite a bit.

Research brought dynamic and Monte Carlo simulations,  
experimental data required analysis automation  
so cloud computing offered attractive adventures  
Oh My! Big data IoT pipelines dockerization!

DevOps has become her fascinating playground.  
Feeling infinite compute power at the fingertips,  
She automates infrastructure up from the ground  
Never having a particular server relationship.

Besides obvious interest of maxing out cloud resources  
She likes unplanned travels and being outdoorsy  
Gymnastics, including mind ones  
And collecting fine peppers for cooking.

In free time she likes rescuing any pet  
especially ones being a “poor thing”.
